### **💻 Java Backend Engineer | 🏗️ Microservices Enthusiast | ☁️ Cloud Whisperer**  

👨‍💻 **Code Ninja by Day, Bug Hunter by Night** 🐛🔍 | **Making Backend Less Boring** 😎  

Passionate about **building scalable microservices**, **optimizing APIs**, and **yelling at unoptimized queries**. From **AI-powered automation** to **cloud-native architectures**, I bring ideas to life using **Spring Boot, AWS, Kafka, Kubernetes**, and just a *little* bit of caffeine ☕.

## **🔥 What I’ve Built (And Broke Before Fixing 😅)**  

### 🏡 **Realtor Vision** 🏠  
**AI-powered property listing automation** using **AWS Bedrock** to generate real estate descriptions faster than a realtor can say *“This house won’t last!”* Integrated **Spring Boot microservices** to process and tag property images from **AWS S3**.  

### ✉️ **Notification Service** 📢  
Centralized **event-driven notification system** (aka “Let’s spam responsibly”) using **Twilio, SendGrid, Mustache, and AWS SQS** to send **personalized SMS, emails, and push notifications**—because who doesn’t love getting reminders they never asked for?  

### 🤖 **Copilot AI Chatbot** 🤝  
Built an **HR chatbot in Microsoft Copilot Studio** that answers questions about **leave balances, payroll, and company policies**. Employees no longer have to email HR for the 10th time about their PTO. **Efficiency = 60% increase. Sanity saved = 100%.**

## **🚀 Fun Facts About Me**  

🔹 I talk to **APIs** more than people.  
🔹 My CI/CD pipeline is more reliable than my sleep schedule.  
🔹 If I had a dollar for every time I debugged for hours only to realize it was a **missing semicolon**, I’d be retired by now.
